In this project, we will perform hierarchical clustering analysis on the USArrests dataset in R. The dataset contains information on the number of arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. The aim of this analysis is to identify clusters of states based on their crime rates.
